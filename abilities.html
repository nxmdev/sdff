          <h1>Abilities</h1>
            <p>
              There are three types of Abilities: Offensive, Defensive, and Class. 
              Offensive and Defensive Abilities gains one bubble of experience each time 
              they are used. Fill the experience bubbles and upon filling the 10th bubble 
              you gain a level in that ability. Ability levels are used as modifiers to your attack 
              and defense rolls when that ability is being used.<br>Class Abilities do not level, 
              can be combat or non-combat, and are not tied to equipment. 
              Choose one Class ability when you create your character and one each time you level up.<br>
            <i>Below is a list of abilities in The Realm.</i>

            <b>&#183; <text class="ability-title-styling">Block</text></b> - An ability given to the character when a shield is equiped. 
            If successful, blocks all incoming damage from the attack it targetted.
            <br><br>
            <b>&#183; <text class="ability-title-styling">Crush</text></b> - An ability given to the character when a one handed mace is equiped. Crush applies 1 wound when successful.
            <br><br>
            <b>&#183; <text class="ability-title-styling">Dodge</text></b> - An ability that all characters have innately regardless of gear. Dodge cannot be used if one 
            of your legs(movement wound) has been fully wounded and incapacitated.  
            Dodge rolls can be heavily altered by using heavy armor. Chainmail(-1), Leather(-1), and Platemail(-2) will lower 
            your dodge roll by the specified amount. This negative modifier is only applied once and is equal 
            to the highest tier armor you are wearing.<br>
            <div class="dodge-example-styling">
              Examples:
              <br>1. If you have 1 piece of Leather, you now apply -1 to your dodge roll.
              <br>2. If you have 1 piece of Platemail, you now apply 
              -2 to your dodge roll.
              <br>3. If you have 2 pieces of Platemail, you still only apply a -2 to your dodge roll.
              <br>4. If you have 1 piece of Leather and 2 pieces of Platemail, you still only apply -2 to your dodge roll.

             <b>&#183; <text class="ability-title-styling">Dual Wield</text></b> - An ability that grants the character the use of 2 one handed weapons. The consequence of this 
             is allowing the attacker to take the highest of the 2d6 attack rolls and use the highest value of the two for both of them. 
             Also this applies both weapon's damage values when the damage is calculated.
