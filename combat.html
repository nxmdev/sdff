          The Attacker also declares the Defender's body part that's targetted. 
          There are vital, core, action, and movement body parts.
          To identify a particular body part, check the mob sheet.

            Each attack, an extra dice is rolled depending on the Attacker's offensive ability level VS the Defender's defensive ability level.
            If a 1 is rolled on the stumble dice, you stumble attempting your attack, and the Defender is offered 1 offensive attack.
            The Attacker is allowed to defend the attack. Stamina is used for both combatants if they chose to attack or defend during this stumble encounter.

          <h3>Bow Combat</h3>
          Bow combat is conducted the same as melee combat, however, there are a few things that are different outlined here.
        
          <div class="bow-box-one">
            When comparing damage vs armor rating,<br> bow's use DEX + Bow Damage.
          </div>
          <div class="bow-box-two">
            Bow attacks cost 1 stamina and always do 1 wound if successful. If a bow's attack damage beats the compared armor rating, 
            Bleed is applied to that body part. Bleed is an ailment that will apply 1 wound at the beginning of that mob's attack phase to the 
            body part it is effecting. Bleed can be stopped by a healing spell or potion.
          </div>
          <div class="bow-box-three">
            Bows are 2 handed weapons that require a quiver in your off hand to shoot. When swapping to a back weapon, both the bow and quiver will swap 
            to your back.
          </div>
          <div class="bow-box-two">
            There is a penalty of -2 to all attack rolls while wearing Platemail and firing a bow.

        <div class="combat-notes">
          A few notes on combat:<br>
          &#183; If you have 1 of your movement body parts incapacitated, dodge is no longer avaliable for a defensive move.<br>
          &#183; If you have 1 of your action body parts incapaciated, 2 handed weapons are no longer avliable for offensive abilities.<br>
          &#183; A fully incapacitated action or movement body part can have a potion used on it.<br>
          &#183; Weapons, shields, magic tomes, and bows are allowed to be equiped on your back including a quiver.<br>
          &#183; When swapping to a back weapon, both main and off hand items may be stored on your back slot. For instance, 
          when equiping a 2 handed maul from your back slot, a 1 handed sword and wooden shield may both be stored on your back.<br>
          &#183; All rules apply to players and mobs.
