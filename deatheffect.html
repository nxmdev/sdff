          <div>
            When your character dies in The Realm you are reborn anew at The Welcoming Chamber, however, a piece of your past will 
            always come with you. When you die roll 1d100 and apply the listed Death Effect at the bottom of your character sheet.
          </div>
            <div class="death-effect-explanation">
              As an alternative way to play, when you die, choose your death effect from the list. Random death effect generation is meant to
              deter dying on purpose to stack certain death effects, such as a transformation or immunity effects, but this is a 
              completely legitamite way to play. If you are playing a narrative or story heavy game, then it is preferred to choose your 
              death effect to help tailor it to the way you died. 
            </div>

            <div class="death-effects">
              <b>&#183; <text class="ability-title-styling">Arrow to the Knee</text></b> - You took an arrow to the knee. Start each combat with one wound to one of your legs. 
              --random event, funny
              <br><br>
              <b>&#183; <text class="ability-title-styling">Curse of Baadhu</text></b> - As you pass through the Underworld, the demon spirit Baadhu curses you. 
              When fighting demons, they gain +2 to their Strength. 
              --curse, demons
              <br><br>
              <b>&#183; <text class="ability-title-styling">Necrotic Rot</text></b> - A part of you didn't resurrect. Name a body part. That body part gains immunity to any status 
              effects, including transformation effects. The rot's accompanying stench alerts mobs of your presence. You attack second no matter your stamina.

              TODO: Death Effects need to be categorized and a box added to mob sheets to show the numbers of which death effects 
              are possible if they kill you so that you don't have to look it up yourself. Possibly categorize death effects into 
              groups divisible by a number of a common sided dice so that you can say group 1 6 sided dice, etc, to roll your death effect.
