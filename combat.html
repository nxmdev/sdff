          <p>In combat you will take turns using your stamina to perform attacks and defensive manuevers.<br>
          Attacks cost 2 stamina and defensive moves cost 1 stamina.<br>
          Stamina regenerates to its full amount at the beginning of each combatants attack phase.<br>
          Your stamina is 5 + (stamina modifier).<br><i>There is a box in the top right of the character sheet to provide you with a place to track your stamina during 
          a battle.</i>
        </div><br> 
        <div class="combat-box-two">
          The combatant with the<br>highest stamina attacks first.<br>
          The Attacker can use one of their offensive abilities to attack the Defender.<br>
          When the Attacker declares an attack, they also declare which body part of the Defender they are targetting.<br>
          To identify a particular body part, check the character sheet to determine which body part you wish to target and apply the modifiers.
        </div>
          <div class="combat-box-three">
            Head (vital body part) -2 attack roll<br>
            Chest (vital body part) -1 attack roll<br>
            Arms (action body part) no penalty<br>
            Legs (movement body part) no penalty<br>
          </div>
          <br><br>

            <div class="combat-centeralign-text">The Defender then uses a defensive skill to avoid damage.</div>          
            <div class="combat-example-styling">Attack roll is 2d6 + offensive skill modifier + dexterity statistic modifier

          <br>
          <div class="combat-box-one">
            If the Defender wins, no damage is taken and the attack phase continues.<br>
            The same Attacker may spend more stamina to perform another attack if they wish<br>
            or save their remaining stamina to perform defensive manuevers when the attack phase swaps to their opponent.<br>
            Mobs will stop attacking once their stamina reaches 3 or lower unless otherwise stated on their character sheet.
          </div>
          <br>          
          <div class="combat-centeralign-text">If the attack is successful, damage is then calculated against the Defender's armor.<br></div>

            Agility + armor rating

          <div class="combat-box-two">
            If the Defender matches or exceeds the Attackers roll, damage is mitigated by the armor and no wounds are recieved.<br>
            If the damage exceeds the armor roll, then the Defender's body part takes 1 wound from single handed weapons and 2 wounds from two handed weapons.
          </div><br>
          <div class="combat-box-one">
            Once the Attacker runs out of stamina or they elect to pass turn, it is now the Defender's turn to be the Attacker and 
            use their stamina to initiate attacks against the Attacker now turned Defender.
          </div><br>
          <div class="combat-centeralign-text">
            The combatants take turns attacking until any 2 body parts are fully wounded(incapacitated) or 1 vital body part has been incapacitated, generally your chest and head. 
            Check character sheet for details on body parts for monsters and other unusual mobs.
