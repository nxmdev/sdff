          Highest stamina attacks first.<br>
          Attacks cost 2 stamina and defense moves cost 1 stamina.
          Attackers can attack until their stamina is used up or they elect to pass(reserve energy).<br>
          A combatant's stamina regenerates to full at the beginning of their attack phase.<br>
          <label>Your stamina is <b>5 + (stamina modifier)</b>.</label>
          <i>
            There is an area in the top right of the character sheet to track your stamina during a battle.
          </i>
        </div><br> 
        <div class="combat-box-two"> 
          The Attacker uses one of their offensive abilities to attack the Defender. 
          Each skill, offensive or defensive, gains 1 bubble of experience for each use. 
          When the Attacker declares an attack, they also declare which body part of the Defender they are targetting. 
          There are vital, core, action, and movement body parts.
          To identify a particular body part, check the character sheet or mob sheet.
          Monsters and unusual mobs will identify body parts.

        <div class="combat-box-three">
          Head (vital body part) -2 attack roll<br>

          If the Defender wins, no damage is taken and the attack phase continues.<br>
          The same Attacker may spend more stamina to perform another attack if they wish<br>
          or save their remaining stamina to perform defensive manuevers when the attack phase swaps to their opponent.<br>
          Mobs will stop attacking once their stamina reaches 3 or lower unless otherwise stated on their character sheet.
        </div>

          If the Defender matches or exceeds the Attackers roll, damage is mitigated by the armor and no wounds are recieved.<br>
          If the damage exceeds the armor roll, then the Defender's body part takes 1 wound from single handed weapons and 2 wounds from two handed weapons.
        </div><br>
        <div class="combat-box-one">
          If the Defender ever runs out of stamina, they automatically take the hit.
          Once the Attacker runs out of stamina or they elect to pass turn, it is now the Defender's turn to be the Attacker and 
          use their stamina to initiate attacks against the Attacker now turned Defender.
        </div><br>
        <div class="combat-centeralign-text">
          The combatants take turns attacking until any 2 body parts are fully wounded(incapacitated) or 1 vital body part has been incapacitated, generally your chest and head. 
          Check character sheet for details on body parts for monsters and other unusual mobs.
